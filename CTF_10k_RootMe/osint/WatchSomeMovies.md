Searching with Google Lenses, we find that this is the Putangirua Pinnacles. With another Google search (`Putangirua Pinnacles movie`), I found a [website](https://www.filmquest.co/film-locations/putangirua-pinnacles-the-dimholt-road/) that told me that LOTR - The Return of the King is the famous movie that has been recorded here.
